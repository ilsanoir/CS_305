Artemis Financial was a consulting company that offered financial plans for customers, such as savings, retirement, investment and insurance. They consulted Global Rain in order to bolster their security against external
threats against their RESTful web application. After finding a number of vulneratbilites in their software, I highlighted those vulnerabilities and suggested fixes for them. Conding securely offers a key element for most
businesses in the form of consumer trust. A business that has never had any data breach, stolen/ransomed information, or random scandal, is a trustworthy business that everyone wants to associate with. Even more so for a 
financial instution like Artermis Financial. The vulnerability assessment gave very useful information about all the dependencies that the software had, their vulnerabilites, and whether or not the software was at risk.
Security was increased by altering how information was being taken in by the software, reducing the likelihood of attacks such as an SQL injection. Depending on the company that I'm associated with, their internal standards,
and overall industry standards, should offer a solid guidleine for finding, assessing and mititgating against vulnerabilities.


After refractoring, the code was tested and another dependency check was run, in order to ensure that the code was still healthy, and that no new vulnerabilities had been introduced due to any changes made.
The Vulnerability Aseessment Flowchart and OWASP dependency check are both tools that I would like to utilize going forward. They offer very good information on just how secure my software is.
I'd gladly show a future employer my Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report. I imagine being able to make a concise and informative document such as that would be a good skill to have in a professional setting.
